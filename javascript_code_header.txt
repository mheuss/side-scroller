       WARNING:

        This is transpiled output from tsc. The typescript source is located
        in the zip file, and can also be found here: https://github.com/mheuss/side-scroller.

        Looking at it this way, as a large javascript file, is unnecessary and not recommended.
        It is harder to read, harder to understand.

        You'd be better off looking at the repo, and reading the README.md file
        to get your bearings. In that read me file, I specifically point you to the portions
        of the code that relate to the different objectives that were assigned.

    STATEMENT ON WHAT I DID AND/OR DID NOT WRITE:

        All the code you see below, I wrote. However, this code has gone through
        a transpilation process. If you'd like to see the code prior to transpilation,
        please refer to the github repo or to the uploaded zip file.

        The summaries in comment blocks before the classes are autogenerated from
        the classes themselves, and from the doc blocks I had provided over each method.

        Other than that, this is all my work.

    RUNNING THIS LOCALLY REQUIRES NODE ON YOUR MACHINE.

        `Npm install && npm run start` from the project directory will get things
        running on your local machine.

        Don't have node? Go to https://mikeheuss.com to see this running. It
        is up to date - I have CI/CD in place that pushes to that address on commit.
