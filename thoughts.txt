Next steps/Thoughts/Scratch Pad:

Side SCrolling:

I am envision multiple levels - and each level will be defined by objects within
an array.

maybe something like this:

gameLevels[each_level]{
    totalLength: number,
    objects: [
        {
            type: 'tree',
            appearance_x: number,
            appearance_y: number,
        },
        {
            type: 'collectable',
            appearance_x: number,
            appearance_y number,
        },
        {
            type: 'enemy',
            appearance_x: number,
            appearance_y: number,
        }
    ]
}

By knowing our current viewport and centering on the character, we can determine
what should be drawn as to when.

Enemy characters are going to need to be treated differently. They'd start at a given
location, but once started, we will need to dedicate time in each loop to move them
towards the character. This will need to be thought through, though.


Animation:

Either implement reverse kinematics or just do a straight up collections of frames I
want to increment through.

Maybe something like:

character[action][direction][frame]

Where action is walk, run, attack, etc. Direction is up, down, left, right, etc.

Or perhaps better:

{
    currentFrame?? Probably not -think this through.
    animationFrames: {
        walk: {
            up: [frame1, frame2, frame3],
            down: [frame1, frame2, frame3],
            left: [frame1, frame2, frame3],
            right: [frame1, frame2, frame3]
        },
        run: {
            up: [frame1, frame2, frame3],
            down: [frame1, frame2, frame3],
            left: [frame1, frame2, frame3],
            right: [frame1, frame2, frame3]
        },
        jump: {
            up: [frame1, frame2, frame3],
            down: [frame1, frame2, frame3],
            left: [frame1, frame2, frame3],
            right: [frame1, frame2, frame3]
        }
    }
}


I'm not sure of my narrative yet. What's the purpose? Right now, we be just running.

There needs to be a point.

Sounds:

It would be kinda cool to feature a father and son (really young, say 5) who are talking
about writing a game together. The father could have the son do the drawing, on notebook
paper. The characters could be stick figures, say, on torn out pieces of paper.

The father could be explaining the concepts of the game to the son, and the son could be
adding, embellishing, and getting excited???

And... i might be getting carried away.

Characters:

CLOUD:
    Drifts along. Can occassionally get pissed and throw lightening maybe down at the
    character below? Need to make it so there is a way to avoid it. Maybe the character
    can jump on the cloud and ride it for a bit? Or the cloud flickers before it strikes?

    Need to think on this.
