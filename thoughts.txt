Character Animator

Character is defined by a series of points that are connected by lines.
The points are called vertices, and they are connected to two lines

A user can click on a vertice and drag it to the new location.
The lines connected to the vertice will move with it. We will calculate the
rise and run of the line connected to the vertice and move the other vertices.

If there are additional lines connected to those vertices, we will move them as well.

The line's lengths will not change, but the angle of the line will change.

The user can click on a button entitled new frame - and the current frame will be copied to
the next, the heading above the line will change, and the user can then manipulate these
vertices below.

The user can click on a button entitled previous frame - and can make changes to that frame.
That change will take place for that frame and all further frames.

There will be a box drawing of all those frames at the bottom with a back and next arrow.
The user can click on those arrows and see earlier and later changes.

Additionally, there will be a box that will show the current animation cycling through
the frames on an infinite loop.

When the user clicks done, all the frames will be output as line commands stored in
an array inside a text area. The user can then copy and paste that text wherever.
